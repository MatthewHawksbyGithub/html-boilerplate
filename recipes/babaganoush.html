    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>A delicious dip made using roasted eggplant and seasonings.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggplants </li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tahini (sesame seed paste)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil </li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>
            Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>
            Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>    
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Place the eggplants on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Use a fork to prick several holes in the eggplants to allow steam to escape during roasting.</li>
        <li>Roast the eggplants in the preheated oven for about 40-45 minutes, or until the skin is charred and the flesh is soft. You can also grill the eggplants over an open flame until they are charred and tender.</li>
        <li>Remove the eggplants from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Once they are cool enough to handle, slice them in half lengthwise and scoop out the soft flesh into a bowl, discarding the charred skin.</li>
        <li>Mash the roasted eggplant flesh using a fork or a potato masher until it reaches a smooth consistency.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic, tahini, lemon juice, extra-virgin olive oil, ground cumin, salt, and black pepper to the mashed eggplant. Stir well to combine all the ingredients thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Taste the baba ganoush and adjust the seasoning according to your preference. You can add more lemon juice, salt, or olive oil if desired.</li>
        <li>Transfer the baba ganoush to a serving dish. If desired, garnish with chopped fresh parsley and drizzle some extra-virgin olive oil over the top.</li>
        <li>Serve baba ganoush at room temperature with pita bread, sliced vegetables, or as a dip for various dishes.</li>
